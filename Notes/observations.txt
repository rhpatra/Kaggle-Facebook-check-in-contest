- In this competition, you are going to predict which business a user is checking into based on their
location, accuracy and timestamp.

- There is no concept of a person in this dataset. All the row_id's are events, not people.

- Some of the columns, such as time and accuracy, are intentionally left vague in their definitions.Please consider
them as part of the challenge.

- In the plots of 20 bins and 40 bins for check ins wrt to x, y locations a large number of check-ins are concentrated
around the centre of the grid and the frequency of check-ins is almost equal in that area. So its going to be tough
to draw a boundary in and around that area.

- For this data the number of classes is huge and number of features is small. So our classifier should be selected and
tuned accordingly.

- You can run the random forest in parallel to grow different trees.

- When you are constructing the random forest, just test the improvements in results wrt to increase in number of
trees so that you can stop growing more trees when you are at the saturation limit.

- Random forests work well irrespective of the number of classes.

- The tree depth is going to decide whether you are underfitting or overfitting the model.

- Bagging vs Non-bagging: Bagging scenario deals with outliers better.
