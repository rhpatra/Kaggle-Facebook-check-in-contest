* Plot histogram of checkins by place ids.

* Try out random forest classifier.
    - Build a version where you can parallelize training and prediction wrt number of trees.

* Do cross-validation to decide the depth of tree.

* Do a baysian optimization to determine the different parameters:
    - Like the size of bootstrap dataset.
    - Number of trees.
    - Size of leaf.
    - Number of features to consider for splitting a node.
